# PList-Net

## Summary
.Net Library for working with Apple *.plist Files.

Designed for plists on the iPhone / iPod Touch (I don't know if apple uses the same format on their Desktop OS, but I guss so)

## Features
Create, Read and Write *.plist files under .Net
Supports *.plist in Biary and XML Format.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Pete Wilson, whose script plutil.pl helped understand and support the binary format of *.plist files.

This library was migrated from Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/iphone-plist-net/) by Michael Teper.
Michael made several attempts to contact Christian Ecker, the original author of the library, but got no response.
If Christian could contact Michael, he will gladly add him to this repo.
